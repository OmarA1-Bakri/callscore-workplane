# G10 Remaining Blockers

**Status:** blocked on non-automatable approvals.
**Automated/local work:** complete and verified.
**External/live work:** not performed and not authorized by this document.

## Automated completion evidence

- Workplane tests: 94 passing.
- Registry validation: 6 runtimes, 17 workflows, 19 resources, 11 policies.
- Runtime status: read-only fake adapters, no live checks.
- JS syntax checks: passed for `src` and `tests`.
- Launch hash verification: 14 draft action hashes match exact action payloads.
- G10 launch-pack regression: `workplane/tests/g10-launch-batch.test.js` verifies draft artifacts, exact hashes, pending approvals, and dispatch denial without Hermes/operator approvals.

## Remaining blockers that cannot be completed autonomously

| Blocker | Why it cannot be automated | Required evidence to unblock |
|---|---|---|
| Formal G0 scope lock acceptance | Requires human product/verifier acceptance of scope and non-goals. | Sign-off entry in `G10_SIGNOFF_LEDGER.md`; `GATE_STATUS.md` G0 updated from `in_review` to `passed`. |
| Trust asset approval | Requires human review/approval of methodology, right-of-reply, correction, disclaimer, sample-size caveat, and brand guide. | Sign-off entry in `G10_SIGNOFF_LEDGER.md`; trust checklist boxes checked in `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`. |
| Exact payload/target approval | Requires operator/founder decision for each exact payload hash and target. | Hermes approval IDs and operator status recorded for all 14 rows in `launch-batch/PAYLOAD_APPROVAL_LEDGER.md`. |
| Final G10 verifier/operator sign-off | Requires human release decision after all prior blockers clear. | Final sign-off entries in `G10_SIGNOFF_LEDGER.md`; G10 checklist and kanban moved to DONE. |

## Safe next state

The project is ready for human approval review. Until those approvals are recorded, every launch action remains `PENDING` and tests prove dispatch remains blocked.
