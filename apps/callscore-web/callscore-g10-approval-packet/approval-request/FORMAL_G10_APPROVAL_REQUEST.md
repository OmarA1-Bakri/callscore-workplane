# Formal G10 Approval Request — CallScore Growth OS Controlled Launch

**Request status:** PENDING HUMAN APPROVAL
**Requested decision:** approve / reject / request changes
**Scope:** G0 scope lock acceptance, trust asset approval, exact payload/target approval, and final G10 release sign-off for the draft-only controlled launch pack.
**Safety rule:** no publish/send/spend/production mutation/live third-party call/money movement may occur before Workplane gate pass and exact Hermes/operator approval.

## Executive summary

The local automated preparation and verification work for the CallScore Growth OS Workplane-controlled launch pack is complete and clean. The launch pack remains draft-only and blocked from dispatch until manual approvals are recorded.

## Approval decisions requested

Please review the attached/supporting assets and record decisions for:

1. **G0 scope lock acceptance** — approve the PRD/non-goals scope or request changes.
2. **Trust asset approval** — approve methodology, right-of-reply, correction policy, disclaimer, sample-size caveat, and BinaryBaron brand guide drafts or request changes.
3. **Exact payload/target approvals** — approve or reject each of the 14 draft launch action hashes and targets in `launch-batch/PAYLOAD_APPROVAL_LEDGER.md`.
4. **Final G10 release sign-off** — approve controlled launch readiness only after the above items pass.

## Verification evidence
