# M10 Documentation / Board Consistency Review

**Verdict:** APPROVE_WITH_FOLLOWUPS
**Scope:** `docs/callscore-growth-os/**`, macro kanban, gate status, release checklist, Workplane specs.

## Evidence

- Macro kanban exists at `docs/callscore-growth-os/KANBAN.md` and tracks M0-M12 plus R1-R5 review lanes.
- Ralplan exists at `.omx/plans/workplane-review-next-phase-ralplan.md`.
- Release checklist, rollback plan, trust assets, gates, PRD, and enterprise implementation plan are present.

## Consistency notes

- M10 status correctly represents an independent review phase.
- M11/G10 is still TODO and should remain blocked until manual verifier/operator sign-off evidence exists.
- GATE_STATUS says G5 passed; after this review, that remains true with stronger runtime binding evidence.

## Follow-ups

- P2: Update GATE_STATUS or release checklist during M11 to reference these M10 review reports and the runtime-binding regression.
- P2: Add a compact release-signoff evidence index when G10 starts.
