# M10 Independent Review Synthesis

**Overall verdict:** APPROVE_WITH_FOLLOWUPS
**Next phase:** M11 / G10 release sign-off pack
**Blocking P0/P1 findings:** 0 unresolved

## What changed during review

A P1 approval-binding gap was found and fixed before sign-off: modern approval records/events now bind `runtime_id` in addition to workflow, artifact, action class, target/payload hash, gate, actor, status, expiry, and ordered request/grant event IDs.

## Verification evidence

- `cd workplane && npm test` → 91 passed, 0 failed.
- `cd workplane && npm run validate` → registry validation passed: 6 runtimes, 17 workflows, 19 resources, 11 policies.
- `cd workplane && npm run status` → read-only runtime status emitted; fake adapters only, no live checks.
- `cd workplane && find src tests -name '*.js' -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 node --check` → passed.

## Lane verdicts

| Lane | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| R1 Code correctness | APPROVE_WITH_FOLLOWUPS | Runtime-binding bug fixed; legacy matcher cleanup remains P2. |
| R2 Security/gate bypass | APPROVE_WITH_FOLLOWUPS | No unresolved high/critical bypass; live adapters remain out of scope. |
| R3 Test adequacy | APPROVE_WITH_FOLLOWUPS | 91 passing tests; added runtime replay regression. |
| R4 Architecture/next phase | APPROVE_WITH_FOLLOWUPS | Recommend G10 release sign-off pack before live adapters. |
| R5 Docs/board consistency | APPROVE_WITH_FOLLOWUPS | Board and reports are present; G10 evidence index remains next. |

## G10 entry criteria

- Keep all publish/send/spend/production/financial/live third-party actions disabled unless exact Workplane gate pass and Hermes/operator approval exist.
- Assemble release sign-off pack from the review reports, validation output, release checklist, rollback plan, trust assets, and emergency-stop evidence.
- Require manual verifier and operator sign-off before marking G10 complete.
