# M10 Test / Contract Adequacy Review

**Verdict:** APPROVE_WITH_FOLLOWUPS
**Scope:** G1-G10 test coverage, artifact/evidence contracts, registry validation, CLI safety.

## Evidence

- `npm test`: 91 passing tests across CLI, registry, G1-G10, helpers.
- `npm run validate`: bundled registry valid.
- `npm run status`: read-only status works and reports fake adapter limitations.
- `node --check`: all source/test JS parses.

## Coverage assessment

- Strong coverage exists for gate denial defaults, canonical gate expansion, evidence/artifact payload hash drift, Hermes event ordering, actor authority, draft-only agents, partner/financial dry-run behavior, observability manifests, hardening, and release-readiness blocks.
- A missing runtime-replay negative case was found and added during this review.

## Follow-ups

- P2: Add mutation testing or table-driven exhaustive classification tests before real adapters are enabled.
- P2: Add contract fixtures for approval records/events once persisted storage is introduced.
- P2: Release-readiness currently validates booleans and counts; G10 should attach signed evidence artifacts before any manual launch.
