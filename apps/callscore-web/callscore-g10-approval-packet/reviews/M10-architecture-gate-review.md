# M10 Architecture / Next-Phase Gate Review

**Verdict:** APPROVE_WITH_FOLLOWUPS
**Recommendation:** Move to G10 release sign-off pack next, not real mutating/live adapters.

## Rationale

The Workplane MVP now demonstrates the core canonical operating layer:

- registry inventory and side-effect taxonomy;
- central Workplane policy decision point;
- Hermes approval cockpit boundary;
- exact approval binding including runtime/workflow/action class/action type/target/payload hash/evidence/gates/methodology;
- draft-only growth/partner agents;
- fake/read-only runtime status;
- observability/replay and release-readiness guards.

## Next-phase options

1. **G10 release sign-off pack — recommended.** Converts review evidence into launch controls, manual sign-off, and rollback/emergency-stop evidence without expanding live surface area.
2. **Real read-only adapters — viable after G10 pack.** Useful, but should wait until sign-off artifacts define safe live-check boundaries.
3. **Program-control-office tracking — useful parallel docs lane.** Can improve governance, but should not replace G10 evidence/sign-off.

## Gate decision

Proceed to M11/G10 preparation once M10 synthesis is accepted. Do not introduce live third-party calls, publishing, sends, spends, deployments, or production mutation during G10 prep.
