## Validation rules

- `Payload hash` must be `sha256:<64 hex chars>` and must match the exact reviewed artifact/action payload.
- `Target` must be the exact destination approved by the operator.
- `Hermes approval IDs` must cover every required gate for the action.
- Any content, target, action, workflow, runtime, evidence, gate, or methodology drift requires reapproval.
