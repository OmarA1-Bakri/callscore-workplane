# CallScore Canonical Subagent Roster

## Canonical specialist subagent layer

This file fixes the operator-facing gap: the agentic system is not only Workplane jobs and cron/status checks. The canonical automation model includes specialist subagents / workflow agents with identity, bounded authority, governance, memory/cadence expectations, and taste/quality standards.

Canonical source roots:
- `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/`
- `/srv/whop-auto/plugin/agent_workflows/whop_auto/agents/`
- `/opt/crypto-tuber-ranked/docs/ops/callscore-gtm-agent-registry.json` maps these subagents to channels, providers, gates, receipts, and rollback paths.

## Non-negotiable agent model

Every proper autonomous subagent must define six dimensions before live operation:

1. Identity — named specialist, not a generic script.
2. Bounded authority — what it can and cannot do.
3. Governance — Workplane/GTM/Whop/Composio gates for mutations.
4. Memory — what it may persist and what it must forget.
5. Cadence + constraint — when it acts, when it stops/reports.
6. Taste — what good output looks like and what it refuses.

Cron jobs and one-shot status checks are not canonical autonomous agents. They can support agents, but they are not the agent roster.

## Roster

| Subagent | Class | Canonical path | Exists | Bounded authority | Governance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | Master coordinator | `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/orchestrator/SKILL.md` | yes | Routes work across workflows, runs health/state checks, coordinates cross-channel intelligence; does not bypass gates. | Uses task-router, state_manager, cadence checks, registry/Workplane gates. |
| `marketing-channel-growth` | Owned public/channel growth | `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/marketing-channel-growth/SKILL.md` | yes | Creates and prepares launch/content assets for X, LinkedIn, YouTube/SEO, Telegram, Discord, Reddit, newsletters, partnerships. | Registry lane + READY_PUBLIC_OWNED or SEND/SPEND/PUBLISH gates. |
| `content_creator` | Multi-platform content specialist | `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/content_creator/SKILL.md` | yes | Strategy, research, draft, polish, platform-specific posts/articles/newsletter assets. | Content remains draft/owned-public safe unless registry permits live execution. |
| `marketing-compliance-linter` | Safety/compliance reviewer | `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/marketing-compliance-linter/SKILL.md` | yes | Checks forbidden claims, caveats, excluded channels, missing gates. | Can approve draft review or block; cannot publish. |
| `marketing-community-drops` | Community distribution specialist | `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/marketing-community-drops/SKILL.md` | yes | Telegram/Discord/Reddit/community copy and rules-aware distribution packets. | Owned channel READY_PUBLIC_OWNED or SEND_GATE for DMs/non-owned/outreach. |
| `marketing-whop-marketplace` | Whop marketplace GTM specialist | `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/marketing-whop-marketplace/SKILL.md` | yes | Whop listing copy, FAQ, screenshots checklist, conversion assets. | Copy/assets can be ready-owned; pricing/payment/product/customer/provider mutations require FINANCIAL+PRODUCTION gates. |
| `creator-video-swipefile` | Creator/video research specialist | `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/creator-video-swipefile/SKILL.md` | yes | Builds video hook/format/thumbnail/CTA/trust-pattern swipe files for GTM. | Pattern extraction only; no copying, no creator accusations, no outreach without gate. |
| `opportunity_matrix` | Market intelligence specialist | `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/opportunity_matrix/SKILL.md` | yes | Scans Reddit/HN/GitHub/X for opportunity signals and content/BD ideas. | Read/research/report; sends/outreach require SEND_GATE. |
| `whop_auto` | Commerce automation specialist | `/srv/whop-auto/plugin/agent_workflows/whop_auto/README.md` | yes | Whop app/plugin runtime for adopt/deploy/reconcile/status/market/commerce flows and entitlement/provider checks. | Read-only/dry-run by default; provider/customer/payment writes require exact consent, manifest, diff, rollback, receipt. |
| `whop adopt-planner` | Whop planning subagent | `/srv/whop-auto/plugin/agent_workflows/whop_auto/agents/adopt-planner.md` | yes | Plans adoption/wiring flows for Whop automation. | Planner only; executor must pass Workplane/Whop consent gates. |
| `whop deploy-planner` | Whop deployment planning subagent | `/srv/whop-auto/plugin/agent_workflows/whop_auto/agents/deploy-planner.md` | yes | Plans deploy/release steps for whop_auto. | No production deploy/mutation without explicit gate and receipt. |
| `whop critic` | Whop quality/risk reviewer | `/srv/whop-auto/plugin/agent_workflows/whop_auto/agents/critic.md` | yes | Reviews whop_auto plans/outputs for gaps and risks. | Reviewer only; blocks unsafe output. |
| `linkedin` | LinkedIn inbox triage specialist | `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/linkedin/SKILL.md` | yes | Manual-input LinkedIn inbox classification and reply drafting. | No send; Omar approval / SEND_GATE before outbound action. |
| `outlook` | Email triage specialist | `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/outlook/SKILL.md` | yes | Outlook/Gmail inbox triage, sorting, draft reply generation. | Moves/drafts only within approved envelope; sends require approval. |
| `autoresearch` | Autonomous experiment loop | `/srv/agents/repos/Claude_Code_Automations/agent_workflows/autoresearch/SKILL.md` | yes | Long-running mutate/bench/keep-discard loops for code/prompt/outreach experiments. | Must have target file, benchmark, metric, budget/stop constraints; no live provider side effects unless gated. |

## Correction note

Any future system map for CallScore / Hermes / Art of War / Whop Auto must show this subagent layer explicitly between Workplane/Hermes governance and channel/provider execution. Omitting it makes the automation look like jobs and gates only, which is false.
